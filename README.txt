Side project meshing wardrobe choices and music tastes. WIP.

Project started on 6/12/2013

Update 1/15/2015
New year, New code.
I've learned so much since 2013, and wanted to put it into practice.

Recent changes:
Changed main background image (hawt)
CSS -> SASS
Added normalize.css
Added modernizr.js

JSLint'd .js file. Cleaned up quite a bit, but still needs some work.
No more goddamn floats. Inline-block FTW.
