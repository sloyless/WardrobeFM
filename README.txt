Side project meshing wardrobe choices and music tastes. WIP.

Project started on 6/12/2013

Update 1/15/2015
New year, New code.
I've learned so much since 2013, and wanted to put it into practice.

Recent changes:
Changed main background image (hawt)
CSS -> SASS
Added normalize.css
Added modernizr.js

JSLint'd .js file. Cleaned up quite a bit, but still needs some work.
No more goddamn floats. Inline-block FTW.

Ideas:
Social Network? (Do we really need another damned social network?)
User profiles
Instagram-style photos? 
Band-tagging instead of hashtags
add retailers, links to clothes or shops, clothes metadata
Users search for bands and will show them clothes people have tagged it
